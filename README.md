## Hey Peopleee!! Welcome to my Profile.

*Hi! I’m **Tejaswini** — a Cybersecurity student with a deep passion for defensive security and user-safety application engineering (coined something new?? lol.)*

> *While most of the people around me are solving assignments, I’m co-leading projects with few of my amazing peers, writing real-world detection logic, simple ui, and building secure platforms and experimenting and brainstorming every late night idea i get. — because I believe in growing **by doing**.*
I'm not waiting for a degree to make an impact. I'm already building the future I want (hoping).

## 🚀 My Flagship Project: ![PhishVault](https://github.com/Tejaswini4119/PhishVault)

**🛡️ **Vision**: Help users test suspicious URLs safely through a secure and minimal web interface.**

**👩‍🔧 **Role**: **Project Lead & Frontend Developer****

- 💡 Defined the initial project scope and feature set
- 🖌️ Designed intuitive, responsive interfaces from scratch using React.js and Tailwind CSS
- 🔗 Integrated APIs and handled error, loading, and user feedback scenarios
- 🔍 Worked with a security-oriented mindset to ensure safe and reliable user flows

👨‍💻 *Co-built with [Pardhu Varma](https://github.com/PardhuSreeRushiVarma20060119) — backend development & security mastermind.*

## 🎓 Student, But…

Although I’m a student, I:
- Work like a developer.
- Think like a defender.
- Lead like a teammate.
- Learn like it’s oxygen.

💬 You’ll find me either:
- Debugging CSS for responsiveness  
- Studying log patterns to detect phishing  
- Writing labs on SQLi, XSS, and more  
- Or staying up late fixing the smallest UI misalignment — because **it matters!.**
